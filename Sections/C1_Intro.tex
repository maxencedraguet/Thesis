Modern particle physics is built around a combined patchwork of theoretical models gathered into the so-called \textit{\gls{sm}} \cite{Schwartz_2013, SMphysics}. In the edifice of science, the \gls{sm} is our current best approach at describing the foundation of Nature at its smallest scale. The elegance of its structure resides in its mingling of mathematical concept such as symmetries and gauge invariance to describe and predict the structure of matter and how it interacts under the strong, the weak, and the electromagnetic interactions. The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism plays a central role in the theory, allowing for the emergence of massive gauge vector bosons through spontaneous symmetry breaking \cite{Englert:1964et,  PhysRevLett.13.508}. The success of the theory has been countlessly confirmed experimentally in hundreds of measurements, particularly by the ATLAS and CMS observation of the Higgs boson in 2012 \cite{ATLAS:2012yve, CMS:2012qbp}. The \gls{sm} is not however a complete theory of the elementary components of the Universe. Gravity is not included, neutrinos masses are observed but not accounted for, and the \gls{sm} does not explain astronomical observations of the existence of dark matter. Mass is also introduced arbitrarily for fermions by introducing Yukawa couplings symbolising interactions between these particles and the Higgs boson. The observation of a strict mass hierarchy between the different generation is therefore not currently explained. Concerning the Higgs boson, while the leading production modes and the decay modes to third generation fermions and vector bosons have been observed, the coupling to lighter-fermions have not yet been measured. In particular, the coupling to the second-generation $c$-quark can be probed for signs of physics \glsfirst{bsm} \cite{PhysRevD.89.033014,PhysRevD.92.033016,Botella:2016krk,PhysRevD.98.055001,GHOSH2016504,PhysRevLett.123.031802,PhysRevD.100.115041}. \\

This thesis present, in its last chapter, an ATLAS search for the $H \rightarrow c\bar{c}$ decay mode coupled with a differential cross-section measurement of the $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$. These analyses are performed jointly to leverage the same strategy and better constrain the shared background. The vector boson $V$ ($W$ or $Z$) associated production $VH$ is used, with the $V$ leptonically decaying to 0, 1, or 2 electrons or muons. This latter requirement reduces the important multi-jet background and provides an effective signature to select data to save through the triggers. The search is performed with the 149 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected by ATLAS during the Run 2 (2015-2018) of the \glsfirst{lhc} at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. \\

The main ingredient for the presented analysis consists in identifying the $b$- and $c$-quarks flavour from the reconstructed structure of their decay called a \textit{jet}. This is a challenging task due to the large event rate leaving to overlapping signatures and the complex structure of jets. Thankfully, the ATLAS experiment generates a tremendous amount of real and simulated data, leading to effective deployement of \glsfirst{ml} techniques. As such, the second central theme of this thesis is the elaboration of evermore complex neural networks called \textit{tagger} to perform jet flavour classification. This thesis extensively describes the latest effort of the ATLAS Collaboration to improve these methods. A complete review of the development and training of DL1d, a hieararchical tagger using the DIPS subtagger built on a Deep Set network to replace the DL1r tagger using the RNNIP tagger. A recent breakthrough in performance has been obtained when adopting single complex neural network based on a \glsfirst{gat} or a Transformer Encoder, in models respectively called GN1 and GN2. This document presents these new taggers in detail, as well as efforts to leverage techniques from the \glsfirst{ai} community designed for Large Language Models (LLM) to optimise the hyperparameters of the large Transformer-based GN2 network. \\

The thesis aims to present a coherent and connected structure leading to the combined \vhbc\ analysis presented last in Chapter~\ref{chap-VH}. First, the \gls{sm}, the Higgs mechanisms and Yukawa interactions are presented in Chapter~\ref{chap-theory}. The experimental conditions of the \gls{lhc} and the ATLAS experiment are then outlined in Chapter~\ref{chapter-ATLAS}. As machine learning and artificial intelligence play an essential role in modern science, perhaps even more so in particle physics, Chapter~\ref{Chap-ML} is entirely dedicated to a review of the field relevant to \gls{hep}. Building on this \gls{ml} introduction, Chapter~\ref{chap-ftag} presents the development of the modern flavour Taggers of the ATLAS Collaboration, reviewing the design and training of DL1r, DL1d, GN1, and GN2. Finally, the \vhbc\ analysis is described in Chapter~\ref{chap-VH} before concluding with a look forward in Chapter~\ref{chap-Conclusion}.
