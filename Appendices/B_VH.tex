\section{Analysis Categorisation}\label{ap-vhCat}
This section offers more details in the categorisation of the $VH(H\rightarrow b\bar{b}/c\bar{c})$ Combined Analysis. The tagging requirements for an event to be in the \glsfirst{sr} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $VH(H\rightarrow b\bar{b})$, strictly two jets must be $b$-tagged and no tight $c$-tagged jets are allowed. 
\item For $VH(H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$, no $b$-tagged jets are allowed and at least one jet must be tight $c$-tagged. This defines three possible signal regions, where a second jet is either tight $c$-tagged ($TT$), loose $c$-tagged ($LT$), or not tagged ($TN$). 
\end{itemize}
Two control regions are defined by modifying the conditions on the tags of the jets in the event: 
\begin{itemize}
\item A combined $VH(H\rightarrow b\bar{b})$ and $VH(H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$ top control region (topCR) is obtained by requiring at least 1 $b$-tagged jet and 1 $c$-tagged jet. The definition of this control region is the core subject of this work and will be further addressed later in this report. 
\item For $VH(H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$ only, an additional control region is defined by requiring a loose $c$-tagged and a non $b$- nor $c$-tagged jets in the event to constrain the significant $V$+light-jet background. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The $\Delta R$ Cut Between Higgs Candidate Jets}\label{ap-sec-vh-deltaR}
The angular separation between the two candidate jets $\Delta R(j_1, j_2)$, as defined in Equation \ref{eq-deltaR}, can be used to define a control region enriched in $V$+jets and $t\bar{t}$ backgrounds since these two processes give candidate jets with a flat angular spectrum while the signal peaks at low values of $\Delta R$. A \textit{high $\Delta R$} control region (High $\Delta R$ CR) is defined using parametrised cuts on $\Delta R$ between the Higgs candidate jets as a function of $p_T^V$. An additional \textit{low $\Delta R$} control region (Low $\Delta R$ CR) for the 1L channel in $VH (H\rightarrow b\bar{b})$ resolved is also introduced (it is merged with the signal region for the $VH (H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$). The philosophy behind the parametrisation of this function is to adapt the cut on the expected angular separation between the two Higgs candidate jets as a function of how boosted they are, as described by the $p_T^V$ variable. For signal events, we expect the $H$ and $V$ to be approximately back-to-back hence $p_T^V$ is a good proxy for $p_T^H$ while benefiting from better experimental resolution, as it is reconstructed from leptons $p_T$ and/or $E_T$, depending on the channel. From physical principals, boosted candidate jets are indeed expected to have a lower angular separation. From the point of view of $VH (H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$, this modified cut represents a significant modification to the standalone analysis that relied on a simple fixed $\Delta R_{c\bar{c}}$ cut. The new cuts are defined by fitting a template function $ c_1 \times e^{c_2 + c_3 \times p_T^V}$ so that:   
\begin{itemize}
\item 95\% (85\%) of the $VH(H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$ signal is below the top limit for the 2-jet (3-jet) signal region,
\item 90\% of the diboson process is above the bottom limit in both signal regions.
\end{itemize}

The results of these fits for the 1L channel are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:drccptvCutsVHcc}, showing the signal yield in a 2-dimensional histogram ($p_T^V$ vs $\Delta R_{c\bar{c}}$) for different tags applied. The cut used in $VH(H\rightarrow b\bar{b})$, in yellow, shows a good agreement with the one derived on the $TT$-tagged (tight-tight) events in cyan and the $LT$-tagged (loose-tight) in green. The $VH(H\rightarrow b\bar{b})$ cuts is chosen so that the kinematic selection of the two analyses is harmonised. In $VH (H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$, the low $\Delta R$ CR does not improve the statistical significance hence this region is merged with the signal region. In $VH(H\rightarrow b\bar{b})$, these CRs are used to extract the normalisation of the backgrounds while in $VH (H\rightarrow c\bar{c})$ the shape of the $m_{c\bar{c}}$ spectrum is also used.  \\
