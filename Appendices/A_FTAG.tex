\section{DL1d with Variable Radius Jets}\label{ap-DL1dVR}
This section presents some plots on the VR-training of DL1d. Figure \ref{apfig:DL1dVRscanf} displays some flavour fractions scans for the $b$-tagging and $c$-tagging.

\section{GN2 public plots}
A comparison of the global performance of this \gls{gn2} model to the \gls{dl1d} and \gls{gn1} models is displayed in the $b$- and $c$-tagging \gls{roc} curves of Figures \ref{fig:GN2rocb} and \ref{fig:GN2rocc}. These results are taken from Ref \cite{ATL-PLOT-FTAG-2023-01}, for which the \gls{dl1d} model was retrained on the same dataset as \gls{gn2}, and the \gls{dl1r} and \gls{gn1} models are taken from Chapter \ref{chap-GN1}. \gls{gn2} delivers yet another significant boost to performance, drasticaly surpassing the \gls{gn1} rejections at all efficiencies considered. The largest improvement is again obtained at lower $b$-jet efficiencies. Compared to \gls{gn1}, \gls{gn2} delivers $\times 1.5$ ($\times 1.7$) the $c$-rejection (light-rejection) on $t\bar{t}$ at the 70\% $b$-tagging \gls{wp} and $\times 1.75$ ($\times 1.2$) on $Z'$ at 30\% \gls{wp}. With respect to \gls{dl1d}, the gains in $c$-rejection (light-rejection) are respectively close to $\times 3$ ($\times 2$) for $t\bar{t}$ and $\times 3.4$ ($\times 4$) on $Z'$.

Models compared are DL1d in orange, GN1 in turquoise, and GN2 in blue. The bottom plots show the ratio with respect to the DL1d performance.

Turning to $c$-tagging, a similar large performance gained is obtained by the new \gls{gnn} family over \gls{dl1d}, although the change on the $t\bar{t}$ is more impressive for the $b$-jet ratio than for light-jet. This indicates a non-optimal choice for the flavour fraction $f^c_b$, which was set at 0.2 for all models.

\section{GN2 supporting plots}\label{app-GN2sup}
This section presents more plots in support of Chapter \ref{chap-GN2}. Figure \ref{apfig:GNxptc_eff} presents the $c$-tagging efficiency per bin for an overall $c$-tagging working point of 30\% per region displayed.

    \label{apfig:GNxptc_eff}
\end{figure} 

Figure \ref{apfig:GNxptc_efffixedl} presents the $c$-tagging efficiency per bin for a per bin light-rejection of 50 for $t\bar{t}$ and 10 for $Z'$. The \gls{gn2} performance dominates across the board, except for the highest energy bin of the $Z'$.

Figures \ref{apfig:GNxptc_efffixedl} presents the $c$- and light-rejection at an inclusive 70\% $b$-tagging \gls{wp}. The equivalent information for $c$-tagging at a $c$-tagging \gls{wp} of 30\% is displayed in Figures \ref{apfig:GNxptc_brej} and \ref{apfig:GNxptc_urej} for $b$- and light-rejection.
